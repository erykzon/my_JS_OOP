#### Principles

- Encapsulation
	- Capapbility to concentrate into a single entity data and code that manipulates it hidden internal details.
- Inheritance
	- mechanism by which object acquires some or all features if ine or more objects
- Polymorphism
	- capability to process objects differently based on their data type or structure

- Simplify the use. we don't know how works internally. it just works
- simplify change managment we can change the internal code, but output has to be the same

#### Polymorphism

- Overloading
- Parametric
